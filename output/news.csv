Is Nebius Stock Your Ticket to Becoming a Millionaire?,Nasdaq,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nebius-stock-your-ticket-becoming-millionaire,2025-10-05T17:20:00+00:00,Key PointsNebius offers customers access to the compute needed to power AI workloads.,"Key Points Nebius offers customers access to the compute needed to power AI workloads. Demand for these services has exploded in recent times. - 10 stocks we like better than Nebius Group › Nebius offers customers access to the compute needed to power AI workloads. Demand for these services has exploded in recent times. Nebius Group (NASDAQ: NBIS) has emerged as a potential superstar in one of the world's biggest growth industries: artificial intelligence (AI). The AI market has grown into the billions of dollars and is forecast to reach beyond $2 trillion within the coming years. And companies offering AI tools and services, as well as those applying AI to their businesses, are set to benefit. Nebius may be one of the first to win since it offers something that tech leaders are scrambling to get ahold of right now, and that's the capacity to run AI workloads. The company sells access to compute, and just recently it signed a multibillion-dollar deal to provide AI infrastructure to tech giant Microsoft. Revenue is already taking off at Nebius, as it surged more than 600% in the recent quarter -- and the company's shares are on track to gain more than 350% this year. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » Considering all this, is Nebius your ticket to becoming a millionaire? Let's find out. The infrastructure buildout So, first, let's take a look at the current AI market and what may unfold in the coming years. Right now, tech powerhouses such as Microsoft, mentioned above, and others, like Alphabet and Meta Platforms, are pouring investment into building out AI infrastructure. They, and even smaller AI customers, need more and more AI compute -- the graphics processing units (GPUs) or AI chips that power AI tasks. Nebius offers this, allowing customers to rent access to it as well as a variety of managed services to support their AI platforms. Some companies, such as Microsoft, for example, may own their own GPUs and data centers but may also turn to Nebius for additional infrastructure. Smaller players might not invest in GPUs but instead rent from Nebius as needed. This means Nebius could attract a broad range of companies during this infrastructure scale-up and beyond. And moving forward, as AI is applied to real-world situations, compute continues to be necessary to power models as they do their job of solving problems. All of this suggests Nebius could see ongoing demand for its services as the AI story unfolds, and that should support significant revenue growth. An increased forecast In the latest quarter, Nebius forecasted an annualized revenue run rate for its AI business of $900 million to $1.1 billion by the end of this year. That's up from an earlier estimate of $750 million to $1 billion. Nebius operates two other units, one specializing in autonomous driving technology and another focused on tech career training, but its core AI cloud business is driving growth and has even reached positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ahead of schedule. Of course, Nebius faces some challenges moving forward, such as funding the necessary scale-up to meet the needs of customers and potential customers. For example, Nebius recently closed a public offering of shares and a private offering of convertible senior notes, raising more than $4 billion to support such spending. So, investing in Nebius involves some risk because the company must build up debt to grow, and at the same time, any potential slowdown in tech spending could weigh on revenue and the stock's performance. This means Nebius stock may not be the best choice for cautious investors, at least at the moment, but could be an interesting option for investors who don't mind these risks. An opportunity for aggressive investors Now, if you're an aggressive investor and decide to buy Nebius, could the stock be your ticket to becoming a millionaire? Let's say you invest $10,000 in the stock, and it becomes a 10-bagger -- if demand continues to soar and earnings climb, this is possible. Such an increase would bring Nebius to a $267 billion market cap, which also could happen in such a scenario. This would bring the value of your investment to $100,000, which is great, but far from $1 million. And all this brings me to the following conclusion: It's unlikely that one stock, on its own, unless you invest a massive amount -- and that's way too risky -- will make you a millionaire. But the good news is that a promising stock like Nebius could help you along the path to millions if you add it to a portfolio that's well diversified across quality stocks and hold on for the long run.

3 Breakout Growth Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,Nasdaq,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-breakout-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-next-decade-0,2025-10-05T17:15:00+00:00,Key PointsMicron Technology is seeing strong demand from the AI sector for its high-performance memory chips.,"For those with many years before retirement, it's imperative to be invested in growth stocks. While perhaps more volatile than low-priced value stocks, over a long period of time, high-quality growth stocks have the potential to compound wealth by leaps and bounds. After the post-pandemic downturn in growth stocks, the AI revolution and the prospect of lower interest rates should reignite growth stocks again. Here are three all-star names trading at very reasonable prices today. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) hadn't been given much credit for growth prior to the AI revolution. Up until AI hit big, Broadcom's strategy was to buy highly profitable and stable semiconductor franchises across communications infrastructure, while adding infrastructure software to the mix in recent years. It was really a private equity strategy designed to buy companies, cut costs, and milk profits. However, the AI revolution and Broadcom's recent acquisition of VMware has lit a fire under its growth prospects. AI turbocharged two of Broadcom's business: One in custom ASICs used by cloud giants for their own in-house accelerators, and another in high-speed ethernet networking chips and optical components. Each of those businesses grew between three and four times over this year relative to 2023, which is stunning growth. And with its massive VMware acquisition closing late in 2023, management not only managed to cut costs, but also accelerate VMware's growth at the same time. By innovating a new data center virtualization platform, concentrating on the largest enterprises with the deepest pockets, and charging a premium, management has grown VMware's quarterly revenue from $2.1 billion to $3.8 billion in a span of just two quarters, even as operating costs went down! Though AI chips and VMware are bound to decelerate, their growth should still be strong for years to come. Meanwhile, these high-growth businesses will soon combine to exceed 50% of Broadcom's total revenue. With AI chips and VMware underpinning growth and the appetite for more acquisitions across both hardware and software, Broadcom is still a buy even near its all-time highs. Sea Limited Southeast Asian e-commerce, fintech, and video game giant Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) was a darling of the pandemic, but fell on hard times afterwards. Its hit mobile game Free Fire saw declines in users and monetization and a ban in India over geopolitical concerns, while higher interest rates lowered growth in its other businesses. However, management showed its agility by cutting costs and achieving profitability by early 2023, within a year after interest rates spiked. Now with profitability stabilized and inflation coming down, Sea is achieving a happy medium between the hypergrowth pandemic era and the slower but more profitable period thereafter. The most recent quarter showed solid growth across all three businesses. The Shopee e-commerce platform grew revenue 33.7%, digital financial services grew 39.5%, and the digital entertainment segment returned to growth after bottoming last year, with bookings up 21.1%. And despite a return to reinvesting in growth especially in e-commerce, the company remained profitable overall on a GAAP basis. Sea seems to have solidified a leadership position over rivals in Southeast Asia's digital economy, which should see strong growth in the years ahead. According to Bain & Co., Southeast Asia's economy is projected to grow at a 5.1% average rate over the next 10 years, even outpacing China. With Sea's stock trading at just 3.5 times sales and still 78% below its 2021 highs, it's another growth stock ready to break out again. Aehr Test Systems Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ: AEHR) makes test and burn-in equipment mainly used to test automotive chips, especially new silicon carbide chips increasingly used in new electric vehicles. Test and burn-in equipment allows chip manufacturers to subject chips to rugged heat conditions while still on the wafer before they are packaged into a device. Hence, why the technology has generally been used in chips that need to function in challenging conditions, such auto an industrial chips. Yet while the EV market boomed in recent years, it entered a severe downturn about a year ago. Hence, why Aehr Test Systems is down 78% from its July 2023 highs. Still, if one thinks the EV market will eventually bounce back, perhaps helped along by lower interest rates, then Aehr could be a bargain buy. Not only that, but the company recently made a consequential announcement for revenues beyond just EVs. On Sept. 5, the company announced it had received an order of six Sonoma machines to test the AI accelerators of a large cloud infrastructure player. This is the first-ever order of Aehr's machines for AI accelerators. Given the increasingly energy-hungry and heat-generative nature of AI chips, it's quite possible Aehr's solutions may be adopted not only by this AI company in greater numbers, but other AI players as well. Given AI's hypergrowth prospects, Aehr may have another great growth segment on its hands, making the recent swoon potentially a terrific buying opportunity.
